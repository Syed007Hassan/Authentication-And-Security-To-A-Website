# Authentication-And-Security-To-A-Website
⋅⋅* Implemented a security and authentication method using Register/Login functionality for a website. if a user has Registered or Logged in, only then he/she will be directed to the secrets page. Where secrets can be added and can see all the secrets anonymously.

⋅⋅* In the First part I have added Salt to Hashing process to force passwords uniqueness, increase their complexity without increasing user requirements, and to mitigate password attacks like hash tables. 

⋅⋅* In the Second part I have used Google Sign Up method for Regsitering a user in Databse. And it does not matter how many times a user tries to register with same email, as the user's GoogleId will remain same.

⋅⋅* Here is a link to why one should use [OAuth 2.0 for Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server)
